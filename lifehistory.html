  <h1>Life History of a Shark!</h1>
</head>
<body>

  <p>
      Shark lifespans vary by species. Most live 20 to 30 years. The <b class:sharkname;>spiny dogfish</b> has one of the longest lifespans at more than 100 years. <b class:sharkname;>Whale sharks</b> (<i>Rhincodon typus</i>) may also live over 100 years. Earlier estimates suggested the <b class:sharkname;>Greenland shark</b> (<i>Somniosus microcephalus</i>) could reach about 200 years, but a recent study found that a 5.02-metre-long (16.5 ft) specimen was 392 ± 120 years old (i.e., at least 272 years old), making it the longest-lived vertebrate known.

  <h2>Reproduction</h2>
    <p>
        Unlike most bony fish, sharks are K-selected reproducers, meaning that they produce a small number of well-developed young as opposed to a large number of poorly developed young. Fecundity in sharks ranges from 2 to over 100 young per reproductive cycle. Sharks mature slowly relative to many other fish. For example, <b class:sharkname;>lemon sharks</b> reach sexual maturity at around age 13–15.
    </p>

    <h3>Sexual</h3>
      <p>
          Sharks practice internal fertilization. The posterior part of a male shark's pelvic fins are modified into a pair of intromittent organs called claspers, analogous to a mammalian penis, of which one is used to deliver sperm into the female.
      </p>
      <p>
          Mating has rarely been observed in sharks. The smaller <b class:sharkname;>catsharks</b> often mate with the male curling around the female. In less flexible species the two sharks swim parallel to each other while the male inserts a clasper into the female's oviduct. Females in many of the larger species have bite marks that appear to be a result of a male grasping them to maintain position during mating. The bite marks may also come from courtship behavior: the male may bite the female to show his interest. In some species, females have evolved thicker skin to withstand these bites.
      </p>
    <h3>Asexual</h3>
      <p>
          There have been a number of documented cases in which a female shark who has not been in contact with a male has conceived a pup on her own through parthenogenesis. The details of this process are not well understood, but genetic fingerprinting showed that the pups had no paternal genetic contribution, ruling out sperm storage. The extent of this behavior in the wild is unknown. Mammals are now the only major vertebrate group in which asexual reproduction has not been observed.
      </p>
      <p>
          Scientists say that asexual reproduction in the wild is rare, and probably a last-ditch effort to reproduce when a mate is not present. Asexual reproduction diminishes genetic diversity, which helps build defenses against threats to the species. Species that rely solely on it risk extinction. Asexual reproduction may have contributed to the blue shark's decline off the Irish coast.

    <h2>Brooding</h2>
      <p>
          Sharks display three ways to bear their young, varying by species, oviparity, viviparity and ovoviviparity.
      </p>
        <h3>Ovoviviparity</h3>
          <p>
              Most sharks are ovoviviparous, meaning that the eggs hatch in the oviduct within the mother's body and that the egg's yolk and fluids secreted by glands in the walls of the oviduct nourishes the embryos. The young continue to be nourished by the remnants of the yolk and the oviduct's fluids. As in viviparity, the young are born alive and fully functional. Lamniforme sharks practice oophagy, where the first embryos to hatch eat the remaining eggs. Taking this a step further, <b class:sharkname;>sand tiger shark</b> pups cannibalistically consume neighboring embryos. The survival strategy for ovoviviparous species is to brood the young to a comparatively large size before birth. The <b class:sharkname;>whale shark</b> is now classified as ovoviviparous rather than oviparous, because extrauterine eggs are now thought to have been aborted. Most ovoviviparous sharks give birth in sheltered areas, including bays, river mouths and shallow reefs. They choose such areas for protection from predators (mainly other sharks) and the abundance of food. <b class:sharkname;>Dogfish</b> have the longest known gestation period of any shark, at 18 to 24 months. <b class:sharkname;>Basking sharks</b> and <b class:sharkname;>frilled sharks</b> appear to have even longer gestation periods, but accurate data are lacking.
          </p>
          <h3>Oviparity</h3>
            <p>
                Some species are oviparous, laying their fertilized eggs in the water. In most oviparous shark species, an egg case with the consistency of leather protects the developing embryo(s). These cases may be corkscrewed into crevices for protection. The egg case is commonly called a <em>mermaid's purse</em>. Oviparous sharks include the <b class:sharkname;>horn shark</b>, <b class:sharkname;>catshark</b>, <b class:sharkname;>Port Jackson shark</b>, and <b class:sharkname;>swellshark</b>.
            </p>
          <h3>Viviparity</h3>
            <p>
                Viviparity is the gestation of young without the use of a traditional egg, and results in live birth. Viviparity in sharks can be placental or aplacental. Young are born fully formed and self-sufficient. <b class:sharkname;>Hammerheads</b>, the requiem sharks (such as the <b class:sharkname;>bull</b> and <b class:sharkname;>blue sharks</b>), and <b class:sharkname;>smoothhounds</b> are viviparous.
