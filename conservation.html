  <p>
      In 1991, South Africa was the first country in the world to declare <b class:sharkname;>Great White sharks</b> a legally protected species.
  </p>
  <p>
      Intending to ban the practice of shark finning while at sea, the United States Congress passed the Shark Finning Prohibition Act in 2000. Two years later the Act saw its first legal challenge in United States v. Approximately 64,695 Pounds of Shark Fins. In 2008 a Federal Appeals Court ruled that a loophole in the law allowed non-fishing vessels to purchase shark fins from fishing vessels while on the high seas. Seeking to close the loophole, the Shark Conservation Act was passed by Congress in December 2010, and it was signed into law in January 2011.
  </p>
  <p>
      In 2003, the European Union introduced a general shark finning ban for all vessels of all nationalities in Union waters and for all vessels flying a flag of one of its member states. This prohibition was amended in June 2013 to close remaining loopholes.
  </p>
  <p>
      In 2009, the International Union for Conservation of Nature's IUCN Red List of Endangered Species named 64 species, one-third of all oceanic shark species, as being at risk of extinction due to fishing and shark finning.
  </p>
  <p>
      In 2010, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) rejected proposals from the United States and Palau that would have required countries to strictly regulate trade in several species of <b class:sharkname;>scalloped hammerhead</b>, <b class:sharkname;>oceanic whitetip</b> and <b class:sharkname;>spiny dogfish</b> sharks. The majority, but not the required two-thirds of voting delegates, approved the proposal. China, by far the world's largest shark market, and Japan, which battles all attempts to extend the convention to marine species, led the opposition. In March 2013, three endangered commercially valuable sharks, the <b class:sharkname;>hammerheads</b>, the <b class:sharkname;>oceanic whitetip</b> and <b class:sharkname;>porbeagle</b> were added to Appendix 2 of CITES, bringing shark fishing and commerce of these species under licensing and regulation.
  </p>
  <p>
      In 2010, Greenpeace International added the <b class:sharkname;>school shark</b>, <b class:sharkname;>shortfin mako shark</b>, <b class:sharkname;>mackerel shark</b>, <b class:sharkname;>tiger shark</b> and <b class:sharkname;>spiny dogfish</b> to its seafood red list, a list of common supermarket fish that are often sourced from unsustainable fisheries. Advocacy group Shark Trust campaigns to limit shark fishing. Advocacy group Seafood Watch directs American consumers to not eat sharks.
  </p>
  <p>
      Under the auspices of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS), also known as the Bonn Convention, the Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation of Migratory Sharks was concluded and came into effect in March 2010. It was the first global instrument concluded under CMS and aims at facilitating international coordination for the protection, conservation and management of migratory sharks, through multilateral, intergovernmental discussion and scientific research.

      In July 2013, New York state, a major market and entry point for shark fins, banned the shark fin trade joining seven other states of the United States and the three Pacific U.S territories in providing legal protection to sharks.
  </p>
  <p>
      As of September 2018, 12 U.S. states (California, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Texas, and Washington) and 3 U.S. territories (American Samoa, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands) have banned the sale or possession of shark fins.
  </p>
  <p>
      Several regions now have shark sanctuaries or have banned shark fishing â€” these regions include American Samoa, the Bahamas, the Cook Islands, French Polynesia, Guam, the Maldives, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Palau.
